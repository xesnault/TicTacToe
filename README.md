# Tic Tac Toe

This is a console based Tic Tac Toe game.

## How to play

The game starts directly when you launch the executable, as a human you can provide an input between [1; 9].
1 is the top-left corner, 9 is the bottom-right corner.  
  
You can play against another human on the same computer, against a random AI or a perfect AI (using minimax algorithm).

## Usage

```
./TicTacToe.exe -p1 [human|random|minimax] -p2 [human|random|minimax]
```

If you omit the `-p1` or `p2` argument, the default is `human`.

## Source code

I tried to make the source code easily understandable if someone wants to learn from it, it's a pretty simple project.
